WorldWatch
==========
Apple has recently launched WatchKit for the Apple Watch. Like any new product line Apple launches, this too has a huge potential as the Watch slowly matures and becomes an indispensable  part of our life. 

This project is an effort to try out the Watch features.
This is a world clock app for Apple Watch which updates the times of the labels real time. I also have put together this tutorial at my blog.
